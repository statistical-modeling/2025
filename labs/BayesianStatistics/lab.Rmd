# Cross validation and Bayesian models

In this tutorial we will explore some aspects of Bayesian models and focus on some different methods for model comparison.

First, let's define a class of linear models called polynomial models. The idea is to use different powers of the predictor variables as predictors, leading to non-linear relationships between the predictors and the response. The likelihood of the model is defined as:

\begin{aligned}
y_i &\sim Normal(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_i^j 
\end{aligned}

where $p$ is the degree of the polynomial model.

We will use a dataset from the rethinking book that relates the brain volume and body weight in different hominids.

```{r setup, echo=TRUE}
sppnames <- c( "afarensis","africanus","habilis","boisei",
"rudolfensis","ergaster","sapiens")
brainvolcc <- c( 438 , 452 , 612, 521, 752, 871, 1350 )
masskg <- c( 37.0 , 35.5 , 34.5 , 41.5 , 55.5 , 61.0 , 53.5 )
d <- data.frame( species=sppnames , brain=brainvolcc , mass=masskg )

library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(d, aes(x=mass, y=brain)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=species)) + 
  labs(x=expression("body mass (kg)"), 
       y=expression("brain volume (cm"^3*")")) + 
  theme_classic()
```
