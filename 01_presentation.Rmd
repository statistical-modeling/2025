 1. **Quantitative Reasoning in Ecology**: Chapter 1 in Schneider,
    D. 2009. Quantitative Ecology: Measurement, Models, and
    Scaling. New York, Academic Press, 2nd Ed. 
	*(Nice synthesis of
    statistical analyses in the context of quantitative reasoning. It has
    also many important highlights on quantities and measurements)*
 2. **Alternative views of scientific method and of modelling**:
    Chapter 2 in Hilborn, R & Mangel, M. 1997. The Ecological
    Detective - Confronting Models with Data. Princeton, Princeton
    University Press. 
	*(The whole book is a [true classic](https://books.google.com.br/books?id=pQabBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&hl=pt-BR&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false) on
    the use of statistical models in ecology. This chapter has a quick
    epistemological review and highlights the key distinction between
    models and hypothesis. It also brings a typology of models, and
    the concept of model complexity.)*
 3. The statistician Galit Schmu√©li researches the important
    distinction between [prediction and
    explanation](http://www.galitshmueli.com/content/explain-or-predict)
    in statistics and in different disciplines of science. Also, see
    the author's [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.0891.pdf) on the
    subject.
