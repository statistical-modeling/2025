Welcome to the Statistical Inference module of the
Serrapilheira Training Program in Quantitative Biology and
Ecology 2024. Statistical models are a useful tool to bridge theory
and data. Why do ecologists fit statistical models? There are three
main reasons: explore data, make inferences, and derive predictions.

## Goal

Our general goal is to provide appropriate conceptual foundations on
statistical thinking in ecology. We will teach you basic tools needed to connect
theory and hypothesis to data and show you additional paths you can
take to further explore more advanced topics. There are two main steps
in this endeavor: (i) the construction and fit of statistical models;
and (ii) the inferences that can be made with and about the models.
