      "contents": "\nSara Mortara\nDiogo Melo\n\n\n\nDiogo’s main research interest is understanding the evolution of genetic architecture, especially how genetic architecture can restrict and alter evolutionary trajectories, and how selection can shape these restrictions. Most of his work is computational, but he has also worked with data from large quantitative genetics experiments, trying to link theoretical knowledge on genetic effects to what is seen in real populations. His work is centered on the evolution of genetic correlations, a topic he explores using several different approaches, including QTL mapping, experimental evolution, computer simulations, and comparative data. Diogo has an undergraduate degree in biology from the University of São Paulo, where he also obtained a master’s degree and a Ph.D. in genetics and evolutionary biology. From 2020 to 2024, he joined Princeton University as an Associate Research Scholar at the Ayroles Lab and lecturer in the Ecology and Evolution Department. He is now\nand assistant professor at the Biology Institute of the University of São Paulo.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nWelcome to the Statistical Inference module of the\nSerrapilheira Training Program in Quantitative Biology and\nEcology 2025. Statistical models are a useful tool to bridge theory\nand data. Why do ecologists fit statistical models? There are three\nmain reasons: explore data, make inferences, and derive predictions.\nPrevious years sites:\n2023 course website\nVideo lectures\n\n2024 course website\nGoal\nOur general goal is to provide appropriate conceptual foundations on\nstatistical thinking in ecology. We will teach you basic tools needed to connect\ntheory and hypothesis to data and show you additional paths you can\ntake to further explore more advanced topics. There are two main steps\nin this endeavor: (i) the construction and fit of statistical models;\nand (ii) the inferences that can be made with and about the models.\nInstructors\nSara Mortara, re.green, ¡liibre!\nDiogo Melo, Universidade de São Paulo\nInstructors from previous courses\nAndrea Sánchez-Tapia, Universidade Federal do ABC, ¡liibre!\nPaula Lemos-Costa, The University of Chicago\nPaulo Inácio Prado, Universidade de São Paulo\nPreparing for the course\nBefore the course starts, follow these\ninstructions to install R  and\nthe necessary R packages in your computer, and also to recap the\nbasics on R we’ll need to start.
