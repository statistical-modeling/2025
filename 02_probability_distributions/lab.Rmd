# Some important things about the Normal distribution

The normal or Gaussian distribution is by far the most used
probability distribution in statistical modeling and also in
statistical inference. This section
will help you to understand why, and also to get familiar with the
properties of this distribution.

## Know your beast: exploring the Gaussian function

Let's start exploring the normal, or Gaussian function as a
mathematical object. Try to forget its meanings and applications for a moment, and
just think on its behavior.

### Parameters

You can think in parameters of a function as radio buttons that you
turn right or left to changes some aspect of the function. The normal,
or Gaussian, function is always bell-shaped. Is has two parameters,
usually referred by the Greek letters $\mu$ and $\sigma$.

The parameter $\mu$ defines the position of the bell-shaped curve
along the x-axis.

Use the R code below to plot normal curves of constant value of
$\sigma=1$, but values of $\mu$ ranging from -2 to 2. The function
*dnorm* returns the value of the normal function. We use the function
*curve* to calculate and plot the value of the normal function over
the x-axis:

```{r}
vals <- seq(from = -2, to = 2, by = 0.5)
cores <- rainbow(n = length(vals))
curve(dnorm(x, mean = vals[1], sd = 1),
  from = -5, to = 5, col = cores[1])
for (i in 2:length(vals))
  curve(dnorm(x, mean = vals[i], sd = 1),
        add = TRUE, col = cores[i])
```

**Challenge:** change the code above to plot normal curves with
constant value of $\mu$ and values of sigma varying from 0.25
to 2. After you try it, you can check one solution unfolding the code
below.


```{r  code_folding=TRUE}
vals <- seq(from = 0.25, to = 2, by = 0.5)
cores <- rainbow(n = length(vals))
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = vals[1]),
      from = -5, to = 5, col = cores[1])
for (i in 2:length(vals))
    curve(dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = vals[i]),
          add = TRUE, col = cores[i])
```

### Getting probabilities from a normal curve

It is important to distinguish the *probability density function* of a
continuous variable and the probability of that variable.

The bell-shaped curve of the normal is a density function. As it is
not a probability, it can reach values greater than one
^[probabilities are bounded between zero and one].  This happens for
the normal density function when the standard deviation is low. See
how this curve goes well beyond one:

```{r }
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 0.1), from =  -0.35, to = 0.35)
```

For continuous distributions, you get probabilities from the area
under the curves of the density functions. The function *pnorm*
returns the **area under the normal density curve** up to a value. We
call this quantity the *accumulated probability*

For example, to get the accumulated probability of a normal  with
$\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$ in R type:

```{r }
pnorm(q = 0, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

Which is the area under this normal curve up to the value $x = 0$:


```{r , echo =FALSE, eval=TRUE}
shadenorm(below = 0, justbelow = TRUE)
```

As you can see in the figure above, the area under the curve in this
case is half of the total area.  Therefore, this area corresponds to
the probability of $p=0.5$.

The inverse function of the accumulated probability is called
*quantile*. A quantile of a probability distribution tells you up
which value a distribution accumulates a given probability. The normal
quantile function in R is *qnorm*. To check what is the value in a
normal curve with $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$ that accumulates half of the
area (or $p=0.5$) run this command in R:

```{r }
qnorm(p = 0.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

Finally, to get the probability of an interval, you can take the difference between the
accumulated probabilities for the upper limit and for the lower limit of the interval:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/dif_normal.png")
```

Take, for example, [the length in centimeters of baby girls at
birth](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/child-growth/child-growth-standards/indicators/length-height-for-age/lfa-girls-0-2-percentiles.pdf?sfvrsn=d5f0d7c1_5),
which follows a normal distribution with $\mu = 49.1$ and $\sigma
=1.86$. This distribution predicts that the probability of a girl born
with length between $40$ and $50$ cm is:


```{r }
pnorm(50, mean = 49.1, sd = 1.86) - pnorm(40, mean = 49.1, sd = 1.86)
```

**Challenge:** Assume that the precision of the length measurement of
the baby girls is $0.1$ cm. Therefore a recorded length of $50.0$ is actually
in the interval $50.0 \pm 0.05$ cm. Calculate the probability of
recording this measurement from a baby girl picked at random.

```{r  code_folding=TRUE}
pnorm(50 + 0.05, mean = 49.1, sd = 1.86) - pnorm(50 - 0.05, mean = 49.1, sd = 1.86)
```

## Simulating samples from a Normal distribution

The R function *rnorm* generates random numbers from a normal
distribution. Let's simulate a sample of 30 lengths of newborn girls
from the normal distribution defined above and then get mean length in this sample:


```{r , eval=FALSE}
sample1 <- rnorm( n = 30, mean = 49.1, sd = 1.86)
mean(sample1)
```

Is the sample mean equal to $\mu$ ? How do you explain this result?
Would you say that the sample mean is a good guess of the theoretical
mean (or expected value) of the sampled distribution? The answer
depends on what you call 'a good guess'.

Here is a hint: if you repeat
this simulation a ten thousand times you will have ten thousand sample
means. Take a look on the distribution of these values:

```{r }
my.samples <- c() # an empty vector
for (i in 1:1e4)
    my.samples[i] <- mean (rnorm( n = 30, mean = 49.1, sd = 1.86))
hist(my.samples)
abline(v = 49.1, lty = 2, col ="blue") # mu
```

The blue line is the value of $\mu$. There are more sample means close
to $\mu$ than sample means that deviate much from $\mu$. The
distribution looks pretty symmetric around $\mu$ too, showing that a
given under or overestimation of $\mu$ by the sample are equally
likely.

If you agree with these interpretations, you probably agree that the
mean of the distribution of the samples means equals to $\mu$. That
is, sample means on average hit the parametric mean of the population
from which the sample was drawn.

In fact, we have a mathematical deduction that proves this result that
we have approximated with simulated samples. The **Law of Large
Numbers** says that the expected value of the distribution of sample
means tends to the value of the expected value (or theoretical mean)
of the sampled distribution (which for the Normal distribution
corresponds to the paremter $\mu$).

On the other hand, the __Central Limit Theorem__ states that the
distribution of sample means tends to a Normal distribution with parameter 
$\sigma$ equal to the parametric standard deviation of the sampled
distribution divided by the square root of the size of the samples. 
In statistical syntax:

$$
\begin{align}
x & \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_x, \sigma_x) \\
\mu_x & = \mu \\
\sigma_x &= \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}
\end{align}
$$

where $x$ are the sample means,  $\mu_x$ and
$\sigma_x$ are the parameters of the normal distributions of
samples means, and $N$ is the sample size.

Let's check how close to these theoretical results our simulations
got. The mean of the ten thousand simulated sample means should equal to
$\mu = 49.1$:

```{r }
mean(my.samples)
```

And the standard deviation of the simulated sample means should equal
to $\sigma / \sqrt{N} = 1.86/\sqrt{30}$:

```{r }
sd(my.samples)
1.86 / sqrt(30) # theoretical value
```


# The Law of Large numbers

The __Law of large numbers__ states that the means of samples of
increasing size will converge towards the mean of the population,
$\mu$.

We can observe that with samples from a normal random variable up to
size n = 5000, with $\mu = 0.2$ and $\sigma = 1$. Look how when
increasing sample size, the sample means converge towards $\mu$.

```{r}
## Vector with sample sizes
ssize <- seq(50, 5000, 50)
## Epty vector for the sample means
smeans <- c()
## Loop over all sample sizes, take samples and calculate sample means
for (i in 1:length(ssize)) {
    amostra <- rnorm(n = ssize[i], mean = 0.2)
    smeans[i] <- mean(amostra)
}
plot(x= ssize, y = smeans,
     xlab = "Sample size",
     ylab = "Sample mean")
abline(h = 0.2, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

__Challenge:__ Adapt the previous code to a Binomial distribution with
parameter $N =10$ and $p = 0.25$ (and thus expected value $Np = 2.5$).
Then create different samples with
increasing sizes, from 50 to 500 points in 10 intervals.

A solution for this can be seen in the following chunk of code (click Show code when you're done).

```{r, code_folding = T}
## Vector with sample sizes
ssize <- seq(50, 5000, 50)
## Epty vector for the sample means
smeans <- c()
## Loop over all sample sizes, take samples and calculate sample means
for (i in 1:length(ssize)) {
    amostra <- rbinom(n = ssize[i], size = 10, p =0.25)
    smeans[i] <- mean(amostra)
}
plot(x= ssize, y = smeans,
     xlab = "Sample size",
     ylab = "Sample mean")
abline(h = 5, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

# The Central Limit Theorem

The __Central Limit Theorem__ (CLT) states that the arithmetic means of
large samples of random variables conform to normal distributions
_even if the underlying random variables are not normal_.

Actually, CLT  applies to the distribution of sums of any
random variable. It applies to the distribution of means because means
are summations too. To show this, we will simulate a sum of a very
simple random variate, that assumes values $1$ and $-1$ with equal
probability. We can simulate a sample of 100 values of this random
variate with


```{r }
set.seed(42)
Y <- sample(x = c(1,-1), size = 100, replace = TRUE)
```

Let's imagine that this random sequence represents a walk where the
value 1 means a step forward, and a value -1 represent a step
backwards. The plot below draws this random walk, starting at position zero:


```{r}
X <- 0:length(Y) # time
Y <- c(0,Y) # adds initial position at zero
plot(X ~ cumsum(Y), ylab = "Time",
     xlab = "Distance from origin", type ="l",
     ylim = rev(range(X)),
     col = "blue")
text(0,0 , "Start", adj =1.3, col ="red")
text(sum(Y),X[length(X)] , "End", adj = 1.3, col ="red")
points(c(0,sum(Y)),c(0,X[length(X)]), pch =19, col="red")
```

The final position of this walk sequence is the sum of the 100 sampled
values. Now let's simulate a million of walks like that, and record
the final position of each one. We then plot the histogram of all simulated
final positions:


```{r }
my.walks <- c()
for(i in 1:1e4)
    my.walks[i] <- sum(sample(x = c(1,-1), size = 100, replace = TRUE))
hist(my.walks, breaks = 50)
```

The distribution of the variable "final position" looks pretty
bell-shaped. Indeed, as this variable is a sum of 100 random
variables, the Central Limit Theorem states that it will tend to a
normal distribution. The mean of this normal distribution is equal to
the theoretical mean of the random variate that was sampled and summed
up, which is:

$$ E[Y] = \sum y P(y) = -1 \times 0.5 \; + \; 1 \times 0.5 = 0$$

You can check the mean of the simulated final positions with


```{r }
mean(my.walks)
```

Also, the Theorem states that the standard deviation of the normal
distribution of final positions tends to the standard deviation of the
random variable that was sampled, divided by the square root of the
sample size.

To check this, we first calculate the theoretical standard deviation
of the original random variate^[Because the final position is a sum
and not a mean, its theoretical standard deviation should be
multiplied by the sample size.]:

$$S[Y] = N \sqrt{\sum(y - E[Y])^2 p(y) } = 100 \sqrt{(-1 -0)^2 \times 0.5 \; + \; (1 - 0)^2 \times 0.5} = 100$$

Now we can check if the standard deviation of the simulated final positions matches $S[Y]\sqrt{N}$:


```{r }
sd(my.walks)
100 / sqrt(100) # value predicted by the theorem
```

And you can add the Normal distribution deduced from the Central Limit
Theorem to the bar plots of the simulated values ^[The argument
`freq=FALSE` used below makes a histogram in density scale, to allow
superimposing the theoretical probability density function]:


```{r }
hist(my.walks, breaks=50, freq=FALSE)
curve(dnorm(x, 0, sd = 100/sqrt(100)),
      add=TRUE, col = "red", lwd =2)
```


## Large enough sample size and skewness

The CLT assumes that the sample size is large, but sometimes it is
difficult to understand what size is enough. This can be especially
true in the case of distributions that are more skewed. For skewed
distributions, a larger sample size may be needed to obtain normal
distribuitions from the sample means than for symmetrical
distributions. Let's compare this effect in the case of samples from
an asymmetric and a symetric distribution, for different sample sizes.

### Samples from a binomial

Any binomial distribution with parameter $p = 0.5$ is symmetric around
is mean. The closer zero or one the parameter $p$, the more asymmetric
is this distribution:


```{r symmetry binomial, echo = FALSE}
bin.ex <-
    data.frame(
        x = rep(0:12, 5),
        grupo = factor(rep(c("p = 0.1","p = 0.3","p = 0.5","p = 0.7","p = 0.9"), each =13)),
        y = c(dbinom(0:12, size = 12, prob = 0.10),
              dbinom(0:12, size = 12, prob = 0.30),
              dbinom(0:12, size = 12, prob = 0.50),
              dbinom(0:12, size = 12, prob = 0.70),
              dbinom(0:12, size = 12, prob = 0.90))
        )

ggplot( bin.ex, aes(x, y, label = grupo)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill=grupo)) +
    geom_text(x=13.4, y=0.15, size = 6) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:12, limits =c(0,13.5)) +
    facet_grid(grupo~.) +
    xlab("Number of sucesses") +
    ggtitle("Binomial distribution, N = 12") +
    theme_publication() +
    theme(strip.background = element_blank(), strip.text.y = element_blank(), 
          strip.placement = "outside", panel.spacing.y = unit(0, "cm")) +
    theme(legend.position = "none",
              axis.line.y = element_blank(),
              axis.text.y = element_blank(),
              axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
              axis.title.y = element_blank()
              )

```


```{r, asym binomial}
bin.s1 <-  c()
for(i in 1:1000){
    amostra <- rbinom( n = 10, size = 12, prob = 0.025 )
    bin.s1[i] <- mean(amostra)
}

hist(bin.s1)
```

In this case, the sample means are not distributed according to a
normal random variable. Repeat these calculations for larger sample
sizes, like 100. What can you observe about the effect of the
sample size on the distribution of the sample means?


```{r, code_folding = T}
bin.s2 <-  c()
for(i in 1:1000){
    amostra <- rbinom( n = 100, size = 12, prob = 0.025 )
    bin.s2[i] <- mean(amostra)
}

hist(bin.s2)
```

Do the same comparison with a more symmetric Binomial random variable
(that is, with a value of parameter $p$ equal or close to $0.5$). The
sample size needed to obtain a normal distribution from the sample
means is lower than in the case of more skewed distributions.

# CODA

A device called 'Galton Board' was used to run the simulation of the
Central Limit Theorem with random walks, well before computers. Check
this out in this [nice video by Atila
Iamarino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YINTTVjBrY4).
