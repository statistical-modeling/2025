# Remembering multiple regression

In [multiple linear regression](../03_linear_models/lab2.html), the
expected value of the response is a **linear combination** of
predictor variables:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
  y_i &\sim Normal(\mu, \sigma) \\
  \mu_i &= \sum^J \beta_j x_{ij} \\
\end{aligned} 
$$

This model is fitted by finding the values of $\beta_j$ that provide
the best prediction of the expected (or mean) response $\mu_i$. If the
predictors are independent causes of the response, the estimated
coefficients $\beta_j$ express the isolated effects of each predictor
on the response. You can check this by creating a Gaussian variable with
a mean value that is the sum of two independent predictors:

```{r,  eval=FALSE }
set.seed(42)
x1 <- runif(1000)
x2 <- runif(1000)
y <- rnorm(1000, mean = x1 + x2, sd = 0.5)
```

and then comparing the coefficients of the multiple regression with
those of the simple regression on each single predictor:

```{r , eval=FALSE }
coef( lm(y ~ x1 + x2) )
coef( lm(y ~ x1) )
coef( lm(y ~ x2) )
```

What happens if the predictors are not independent? Simulate two
predictors that share a common cause, that is an unknown variable
$u$. The common cause creates a correlation between the two
predictors:


```{r , eval=FALSE }
u <- runif(100)
x1 <- rnorm(100, mean = u, sd =0.1)
x2 <- rnorm(100, mean = u, sd =0.1)
y <-  rnorm(100, mean = x1 + x2, sd =0.1)
plot(x2 ~ x1)
```

And now the coefficients of each predictor in the multiple model are
much smaller than their isolated effects (estimated from simple
regressions):

```{r , eval=FALSE }
coef( lm(y ~ x1 + x2) )
coef( lm(y ~ x1) )
coef( lm(y ~ x2) )
```

This happens because the coefficients of a multiple regression express
**partial or controlled effects**, that is, the direct effects of each
predictor when all the other predictors are held constant (and are
not accounted for by other predictors). Thus, the coefficients of a
multiple regression for a predictor $x_1$ correspond to the
coefficients of a simple regression of the response as a function of
the **residuals** of $x_1$ in respect to all other predictors $x_i$.

Calculate the residuals of the predictors $x_1$ and $x_2$
to each other and plot $y$ as a
function of each of these residual variables:


```{r, eval=FALSE }
x1_res <- residuals( lm(x1 ~ x2) )
x2_res <- residuals( lm(x2 ~ x1) )

par(mfcol = c(2,2))
plot(y ~ x1, main = "y ~ x1")
abline( lm(y ~ x1) )
plot(y ~ x1_res, main = "y ~ x1|x2", xlab = "residuals of x1 ~ x2")
abline( lm(y ~  x1_res))
plot(y ~ x2, main = "y ~ x2")
abline( lm(y ~x2) )
plot(y ~ x2_res, main = "y ~ x2|x1", xlab = "residuals of x2 ~ x1")
abline( lm(y ~  x2_res))
par(mfcol = c(1,1))
```

The coefficients of $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the multiple regression are the
slopes of the lines in the lower row of the plots in the figure
above. These slopes are smaller than those of the linear regression to
the raw values of the predictors (first row of plots above). You can
check this by comparing the coefficients of these regressions to the
multiple regression coefficients:

```{r , eval=FALSE }
coef( lm(y ~ x1 + x2) )
coef( lm(y ~x1_res) )
coef( lm(y ~x2_res) )
```

In short, coefficients of multiple regression express direct effects,
controlled for all other predictors. The inference of the causal paths
behind these partialled effects is not trivial, because such effects
can have different meanings. Independent variables in a multiple
regression can play different roles, such as confounders, mediators
or proxies.  If you understand that, you can infer some important
aspects of the causal patterns from different linear models.


# Good controls

When fitting causal models, it is often necessary to add covariates to a linear model in order to correctly identify the effect of interest. This means running a multiple regression in which one of the coefficients is related to the causal path of interest, and the others are added to the model in order to block non-causal paths. Many of the examples in this tutorial are from [Cinelli, Carlos, Andrew Forney, and Judea Pearl. "A crash course in good and bad controls." Sociological Methods & Research (2021): 00491241221099552.](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r493.pdf)

For example, in the following DAGs, where X, Y and Z are observed, and U is unobserved:

![](figs/good_controls_1.png)

There is always a shared common cause between X and Y, and estimating
the effect of X on Y requires blocking this non-causal path, by
including the shared cause (or confound variable) as a control in the
model. The variable Z can be used as a covariate in all cases, even in
the presence of the unobserved confound U.

Let's check this by simulating the DAG in model 2:

```{r, eval=FALSE }
N = 100
U = rnorm(N)
b_zu = 0.5
Z = rnorm(N, b_zu * U)
b_xz = 0.8
X = rnorm(N, b_xz * Z)
b_yu = 1
b_yx = 1
Y = rnorm(N, b_yu * U + b_yx * X)

lm(Y ~ X) |> coef() # Biased by non-causal path, effect of X is overestimated
lm(Y ~ X + Z) |> coef() # Unbiased, effect of X is correct and equal to b_yx
```


The same logic applies if the confound is mediated by another variable M:

![](figs/good_controls_2.png)

Z should be added as a covariate in all of these cases. 


__Question__: If we are interested in the effect of X on Y, could M
also be added to the model? Explain.

__Exercise__: Choose one of these DAGs and run a simulation, explore
the effect of adding Z or M as covariates.

## Pretty good controls

Some covariates can be added to a model not to avoid bias, but to
increase precision. For example, in the following DAG:

```{r, out.height=100, out.width=100, echo=FALSE,  eval =TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/pretty_good.png")
```

In this case, adding Z as a covariate increases the precision of the
estimate of the effect of X on Y.

Again, let's check using simulations, and then check the posterior
distributions of the estimated effects of X on Y:

```{r, eval=FALSE }
set.seed(2)
library(rethinking)
N = 200
X = rnorm(N)
Z = rnorm(N)
b_yx = 1
b_yz = 2
Y = rnorm(N, b_yx * X + b_yz * Z)
## Fit models without and with confound as a control, and generate posterior distributions
yx = lm(Y ~ X) |> extract.samples()
yxz = lm(Y ~ X + Z) |> extract.samples()
## Density histogram of posteriors
dens(yxz$X, lwd = 2, col = 2, xlim = c(0.4, 1.65), xlab = "b_yx")
dens(yx$X, lwd = 2, col = 1, add =TRUE)
```

The posterior distributions of the coefficient for X have the same
mean, but different variances. This happens because adding the
covariate removes part of the variation in Y that is not associated
with X, which decreases the variance of the estimated effect of X (or
increases its precision, which is the same).

__Question__: What if Z is a cause of X, not of Y. Would adding it to the regression help in this case?

# Bad controls

Two classes of bad controls are the post-treatment or overcontrol bias, and bias amplification. 

In the following DAGs, controlling on Z would lead to a underestimate of the effect of X on Y.

```{r, out.height=150, out.width=550, echo=FALSE, eval =TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/overcontrol.png")
```

In the following case, controlling on Z would lead to an increase in the bias caused by the unobserved variable U.

```{r, out.height=150, out.width=210, echo=FALSE, eval =TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/bias_amplification.png")
```

__Exercise__: Simulate the bias amplification example and check the effect of including the Z variable in the model.

## AIC and significance won't help you

To explore the effect of a bad control variable, let's simulate a collider:

```{r, eval=FALSE }
# DAG : X -> Z <- Y
N = 200
X = rnorm(N)
Y = rnorm(N)
Z = rnorm(N, Y + X)

m1 = lm(Y~X)   # Correct model
m2 = lm(Y~X+Z) # Model including the collider
```

First, let's look at the significance of the variables in both models:

```{r, eval=FALSE }
summary(m1)
summary(m2)
```

Not including Z gives the correct estimate of no effect of X on Y, but the model including Z tells us that both X and Z have significant effects on Y. Why is this?

Many researchers would interpret the significant results in model 2 as evidence that both X and Z affect Y, don't make this mistake! Statistical models are blind to causes, they only capture associations.

How about AIC? Would model comparison identify the correct model?

```{r, eval=FALSE }
library(bbmle)
AICctab(m1, m2, mnames = c("Correct", "Biased"),
        base=TRUE, weights = TRUE, nobs = N)
```

The biased model is also selected by the AIC. This is not surprising, as the inclusion of the collider increases the available information about Y, and so makes better predictions.

__The only way to identify the possible bias is having a clear scientific model.__

# Practice DAGs

## dagitty package

Much of the causal implications contained in DAGs can be analyzed automatically. 
The dagitty package provides functions for this.

```{r,  eval =FALSE}
## if(!require("dagitty")) install.packages("dagitty")
## library(dagitty)
```

## Some DAGs to explore

For each of the following DAGs from the rethinking book, write down
the correct models for estimating the total causal influence of X on
Y:

```{r, out.height=285, out.width=400, echo=FALSE, eval =TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/dags_6M3.png")
```

You can check your answers using the dagitty package or the [online
interface](http://www.dagitty.net/dags.html)^[For begginers, we
reccomend to start playing with this interface, and then check the
results with the `dagitty` package]. Here is an example:

```{r, eval=FALSE }
dag1 = dagitty('dag { X -> Y Z -> X Z -> Y A -> Z A -> Y}')

# Plotting the dag, we can use coordinates to place the nodes in the desired position
coordinates( dag1 ) <-
    list( x=c(X = 0, Y = 2, Z = 1, A = 2),
          y=c(X = 0, Y = 0, Z = -1, A = -1) )
plot(dag1)

# get all paths from X to Y
paths(dag1, from = "X", to = "Y")

# get the correct adjustment set
adjustmentSets(dag1, exposure = "X", outcome = "Y")
```
